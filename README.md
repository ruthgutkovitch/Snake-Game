# Snake-Game

*Explanation:
in the game, the player uses the arrow keys to move the snake around the board. As the snake finds food, it eats the food and thereby grows longer. 
The game ends when the snake moves off the screen.The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens.

*This program uses time, random and pygame libraries.
